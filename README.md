# Computer Science Notebooks

This is an archive of the notes I've taken on various CS books, lectures, and lessons. Rather than creating a dozen different repos I'd never revisit, I figured it'd be easier to just stuff them all in one location. This is the sister-project to [Anatomy of Code](https://github.com/mdawsondev/anatomy-of-code) which I use to pick apart documents and take notes on programming languages themselves.

Here's a plate of spaghetti, because emojis make note-taking feel **a lot** less like Hell.
