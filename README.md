# Computer Science Notebooks

This is an archive of the notes I've taken on various CS books, lectures, and lessons. Rather than creating a dozen different repos I'd never revisit, I figured it'd be easier to just stuff them all in one location.

This is the sister-project to _Anatomy of Code_ which I use to pick apart documents and take notes on programming languages themselves.
