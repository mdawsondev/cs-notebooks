# HTML5 Fundamentals

[HTML5 Fundamentals](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/html5-fundamentals/table-of-contents) specifically covers the HTML5 aspects of HTML. I decided to go ahead and take notes on this course to refresh myself since I've been spending so much time playing with JavaScript that I've been neglecting my HTML5 skills. ðŸ˜œ

## Introduction

The docs for HTML5 can be found at [HTML5.org](https://platform.html5.org).

The three major standard bodies responsible for HTML development are W3C, WHATWG, and ECMASCRIPT.

The point of a lot of HTML5 elements is not to add new features, but to add semantic readability. For example, `<main>` represents the most important content. `<article>` is a way to group information together and signal to the search engine that the content is important.

Others Noteables:

* `aside`: Used to flag important content but not crucial.
* `section`: Used to group logically grouped data.
* `header`: Used to signal header content.
* `footer`: Used to signal footer content.
* `nav`: Explicially reserved for navigation menus and links.

### Spealized Elements

* `time`: Semantically represent time.
* `figure`/`figcaption`: Meant to give semantic meaning to images.
* `details`/`summary`: A No-JS way of adding interactivity to details.
* `mark`: Intended to highlight matched text for search results.
* `wbr`: Signals where to break long words (wordbreak).
* `output`: Semantic tag to support output results (like calc results).
* `embed`: Host container for plugins, becoming less common.

### Elements with APIs

* `canvas`: Used for drawing on the page.
* `audio`/`video`: For audio or video embedding. 

### Form Elements

* `meter`: Used to visually demonstrate value between a set threshold.
* `progress`: A native progress bar to show progression without JS.
* `math`: Used for MathML elements.
* `datalist`: A list of elements shown as options in an input field.

### HTML4 to HTML5

Just some quick notes since I'm pretty familiar with the changes.

* DOCTYPE dropped casting in favor of `html`.
* Scripts and Style dropped `type=""` for internal code.
* `main` should only appear once on a page, housing the main content.
* `nav` represents internal navigation and should not point externally.
* `article` can be used many times, but is good for blocking similars.
* `section` used for logical grouping, `div` is for visual sectioning.
* `a` now capable of wrapping block elements.
* Attributes do not always need to be declared, eg. `<description open>`.

### HTML5 Boilerplate

Discusses [HTML5 Boilerplate](https://html5boilerplate.com); this is optional but lets you jump into projects quicker. Applies items like `normalize.css` and modernizr.

The boilerplate does come with opinionated decisions, but comes with a lot of useful quick-build features. If you head to [Initializr](https://initializr) you can customize your Boilerplate download so you can add or remove various features.

### Fallback Support

Features should be checked via Modernizr and CanIUse. Modernizr is considered a must-have to ensure support.

There are also fallback and polyfill features that can be implemented to support older browsers. **Fallbacks** are typically imported APIs that offer the same functionality for a non-supported feature, while **polyfills** are used to hardcode features into the scripts. The idea is that pollyfills can be removed once the feature becomes more supported without breaking anything.

[HTML5Please](https://html5please.com) can be used to hunt down fallbacks and polyfills to enable simple support.

### Summary

HTML5 is the collection of new elements and new JavaScript APIs, forming a larger web platform foundation.
